## Usage Examples

### Basic Compensation Calculation
```python
from app.services.ccnl_calculator_engine import EnhancedCCNLCalculator
from app.models.ccnl_data import CCNLSector, GeographicArea, CompanySize

# Create calculator (assumes CCNL data is loaded)
calculator = EnhancedCCNLCalculator(ccnl_agreement)

# Calculate comprehensive compensation
compensation = calculator.calculate_comprehensive_compensation(
    level_code="C2",
    seniority_months=60,
    geographic_area=GeographicArea.NORD,
    company_size=CompanySize.LARGE,
    include_allowances=True
)

print(f"Annual gross: ‚Ç¨{compensation.gross_total:,.2f}")
print(f"Annual net: ‚Ç¨{compensation.net_total:,.2f}")
```

### Complex Query Example
```python
# Answer: "What would be the total compensation for a C2 level metalworker 
# in Northern Italy with 5 years of experience including all allowances 
# and leave entitlements?"

result = calculator.answer_complex_query(
    level_code="C2",
    worker_category=WorkerCategory.OPERAIO,
    geographic_area=GeographicArea.NORD,
    seniority_years=5,
    include_all_benefits=True
)

# Result includes:
# - Complete compensation breakdown
# - All leave entitlements  
# - Seniority benefits
# - Working hours info
# - Summary statistics
```

### Career Progression Analysis
```python
# Analyze 25-year career progression
progression_path = [
    ("C1", 24),  # 2 years as C1
    ("C2", 36),  # 3 years as C2  
    ("B1", 60),  # 5 years as B1
    ("5", 120)   # 10 years as Impiegato
]

result = calculator.calculate_career_progression(
    starting_level="C1",
    progression_path=progression_path,
    starting_date=date(2004, 1, 1)
)

print(f"Total career earnings: ‚Ç¨{result['total_earnings']:,.2f}")
