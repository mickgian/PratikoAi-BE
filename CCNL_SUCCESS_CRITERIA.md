- **B (80-84%)**: Satisfactory compliance, several improvements needed
- **C+ (75-79%)**: Fair compliance, significant improvements required
- **C (70-74%)**: Poor compliance, major improvements required
- **D (60-69%)**: Failing compliance, system requires substantial work
- **F (0-59%)**: Critical failure, system not meeting basic requirements

### Success Criteria Weights
- Coverage Analysis: 25%
- Query Capabilities: 20%
