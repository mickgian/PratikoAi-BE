# ðŸš€ PratikoAI System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to fully configure and utilize all the advanced systems in your PratikoAI repository.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Your repository includes several sophisticated systems that require optional external setup:

- **ðŸš€ Feature Flag System** - Dynamic feature toggles with testing workflows
- **âš¡ Failure Recovery System** - ML-powered deployment failure detection and recovery
- **ðŸ”„ CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing and deployment orchestration
- **ðŸ“Š Version Management** - Intelligent version tracking and release automation
- **ðŸ“¢ Notification Systems** - Slack/Teams integration for alerts

## âœ… Quick Start (No Setup Required)

All GitHub Actions workflows are designed to work **immediately** without any external setup. They will:
- âœ… Pass all checks with demo/fallback data
- âœ… Show example outputs and summaries
- âœ… Demonstrate system capabilities safely

To see the systems in action, simply create a PR - the workflows will run with demo data.

## ðŸ”§ Optional Configuration for Full Features

### 1. Feature Flag System

#### Required for Full Functionality:
- **Feature Flag API Service** (optional)
- **API Keys and URLs**

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Deploy Feature Flag Service** (if you want real feature flags):
   ```bash
   # Example deployment to your cloud provider
   cd feature-flags/
   python feature_flag_service.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
   - Add these secrets:
     ```
     FEATURE_FLAG_API_URL: https://your-api-domain.com
     FEATURE_FLAG_API_KEY: your-secure-api-key
     ```

3. **Create Flag Scenarios File**:
   ```bash
   # Create feature-flags/ci_cd/flag-scenarios.yaml
   cp feature-flags/ci_cd/flag-scenarios.example.yaml feature-flags/ci_cd/flag-scenarios.yaml
   # Edit with your specific flag configurations
   ```

#### Without Setup:
- âœ… Workflows will use demo API endpoints
- âœ… All tests pass with simulated flag states
- âœ… PR comments show example results

---

### 2. Slack Integration

#### Required for Notifications:
- **Slack Workspace Access**
- **Webhook URL**

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Create Slack App**:
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Create new app for your workspace
   - Enable Incoming Webhooks
   - Create webhook for desired channel

2. **Add GitHub Secret**:
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. **Create Notification Channels**:
   - `#deployment-alerts` - For CI/CD notifications
   - `#feature-flags` - For flag testing results
   - `#system-health` - For failure recovery alerts

#### Without Setup:
- âœ… Slack notification jobs are automatically skipped
- âœ… No workflow failures
- âœ… All other features work normally

---

### 3. Failure Recovery System

#### Required for Production Use:
- **Monitoring System Integration** (Prometheus/Grafana/DataDog)
- **Infrastructure Access** (Kubernetes/Docker/Cloud APIs)
- **Alert Manager Setup**

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Configure Monitoring**:
   ```yaml
   # Add to your monitoring config
   failure_recovery:
     endpoints:
       - http://your-app.com/health
       - http://your-api.com/status
     thresholds:
       error_rate: 5.0
       response_time: 1000
   ```

2. **Set Infrastructure Secrets**:
   ```
   KUBECONFIG_DATA: base64-encoded-kubeconfig
   DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN: your-registry-token
   CLOUD_PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS: provider-specific-credentials
   ```

3. **Deploy Recovery Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Copy to your infrastructure
   cp failure-recovery-system/* /opt/pratiko-recovery/
   chmod +x /opt/pratiko-recovery/*.py
   ```

#### Without Setup:
- âœ… Recovery system runs in demo/dry-run mode
- âœ… Shows example categorization and strategies
- âœ… All analysis and reporting works
- âœ… No actual infrastructure changes made

---

### 4. External Testing Dependencies

#### For Complete Test Coverage:
- **Node.js/npm setup** for frontend tests
- **Python test frameworks** (pytest, coverage)
- **E2E testing tools** (Playwright, Selenium)

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm install
   npm install --save-dev playwright @playwright/test
   
   # Backend
   pip install pytest pytest-cov coverage
   ```

2. **Configure Test Commands**:
   ```json
   // package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test": "jest --coverage",
       "test:e2e": "playwright test"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Without Setup:
- âœ… Test steps use `continue-on-error: true`
- âœ… Workflows complete successfully
- âœ… Show demo test results

## ðŸŽ¯ Progressive Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Use (No Setup)
1. Create PR to trigger workflows
2. Review demo outputs and summaries
3. Understand system capabilities
4. Plan your integration approach

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Choose 1-2 systems)
1. Pick highest-value system for your use case
2. Set up required secrets/dependencies
3. Test with real data/services
4. Iterate and improve

### Phase 3: Full Integration (All systems)
1. Complete all optional setups
2. Customize for your specific needs
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Train team on new capabilities
