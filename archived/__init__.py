"""Archived code from Phase 5 template-heavy proactivity architecture.

DEV-178: These modules have been archived as part of the LLM-First migration.
They are kept for backwards compatibility but should not be used for new development.

Use instead:
- app.services.proactivity_engine_simplified for proactivity decisions
- app.core.proactivity_constants for CALCULABLE_INTENTS and DOCUMENT_ACTION_TEMPLATES
- app.services.llm_response_parser for parsing LLM responses
