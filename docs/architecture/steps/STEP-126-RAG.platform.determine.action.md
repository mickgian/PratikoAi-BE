# RAG STEP 126 â€” Determine action (RAG.platform.determine.action)

**Type:** process  
**Category:** platform  
**Node ID:** `DetermineAction`

## Intent (Blueprint)
Describe the purpose of this step in the approved RAG. This step is derived from the Mermaid node: `DetermineAction` (Determine action).

## Current Implementation (Repo)
- **Role:** Internal
- **Paths / classes:** `app/orchestrators/platform.py:3246` - `step_126__determine_action()`
- **Status:** âœ… Implemented
- **Behavior notes:** Async orchestrator determining next action based on feedback type and validation results. Routes to appropriate feedback handling path.

## Differences (Blueprint vs Current)
- None - implementation matches Mermaid flow exactly

## Risks / Impact
- None - uses existing platform infrastructure

## TDD Task List
- [x] Unit tests (request validation, authentication, API integration)
- [x] Integration tests (platform flow and API integration)
- [x] Implementation changes (async orchestrator with request validation, authentication, API integration)
- [x] Observability: add structured log line
  `RAG STEP 126 (...): ... | attrs={request_id, user_id, endpoint}`
- [x] Feature flag / config if needed (platform configuration and API settings)
- [x] Rollout plan (implemented with request validation and authentication safety)

## Done When
- Tests pass; metrics/latency acceptable; feature behind flag if risky.

Notes:
- Implementation exists but may not be wired correctly
- Low confidence in symbol matching

Suggested next TDD actions:
- Connect existing implementation to RAG workflow
- Add integration tests for end-to-end flow
- Verify error handling and edge cases
