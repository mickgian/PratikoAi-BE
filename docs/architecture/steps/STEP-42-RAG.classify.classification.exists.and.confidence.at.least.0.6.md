# RAG STEP 42 — Classification exists and confidence at least 0.6? (RAG.classify.classification.exists.and.confidence.at.least.0.6)

**Type:** decision  
**Category:** classify  
**Node ID:** `ClassConfidence`

## Intent (Blueprint)
Describe the purpose of this step in the approved RAG. This step is derived from the Mermaid node: `ClassConfidence` (Classification exists and confidence at least 0.6?).

## Current Implementation (Repo)
- **Role:** Node
- **Status:** 🔌
- **Paths / classes:** `app/orchestrators/classify.py:562` - `step_42__class_confidence()`
- **Behavior notes:** Runtime boundary; checks classification confidence at 0.6 threshold; routes based on confidence levels.

## Differences (Blueprint vs Current)
- None - implementation matches Mermaid flow exactly

## Risks / Impact
- None - uses existing classification infrastructure

## TDD Task List
- [x] Unit tests (classification logic, domain/action scoring, Italian keywords)
- [x] Integration tests (classification flow and domain routing)
- [x] Implementation changes (async orchestrator with classification logic, domain/action scoring, Italian keywords)
- [x] Observability: add structured log line
  `RAG STEP 42 (...): ... | attrs={domain, action, confidence_score}`
- [x] Feature flag / config if needed (classification thresholds and keyword mappings)
- [x] Rollout plan (implemented with classification accuracy and performance safety)

## Done When
- Tests pass; metrics/latency acceptable; feature behind flag if risky.
